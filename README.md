# graph-theory-algorithms
Java implementation of Graph Algorithms like DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, A* and so on....

1) Depth First Search (DFS) <br>
	- Compute a graph's minimum spanning tree <br>
	- Detect and find cycles in a graph <br>
	- Check if a graph is bipartite <br>
	- Find strongly connected components <br>
		- Kosaraju's Algorithm implementation (https://github.com/zephyrpawan/hw5.1-the-un-problem)
	- Topologically sort the nodes of the graph <br>
	- Find bridges and articulation points <br>
	- Find augmenting paths in a flow network <br>
	- Generate mazes <br>
	
2) BFS
